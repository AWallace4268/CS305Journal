# CS305Journal
1.This is my submission for my last assignment in CS305
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

The client is Global Rain, we will be implementing security updates to Artemis Financial in order for them to update their current application.

2.What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I notified the company about security vulnerabilties. I also let them know that some of these security issues can be fixed my implementing encryption to the software. I recommended AHS-256 for them, because this is the most secure encryption to date.

3.Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 

The most challenging part for me was identifying false positives in our tests. This is because it was new to me when implementing security measures. 

4.How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I used multiple tests when it came to implementing my code. I ran smaller sections before running the overall test to make sure what I was building could actual be ran.

5.What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I will be attaching the project two file along with this. This shows my ability to implement encryption to our tests. As well as showing my ability to implement maven projects as well as spring application usage.
